Hello everyone. The purpose of this application is a simple stock and shelf management. I used **React, Typescript, TailwindCSS, Axios, react-router-dom and react-icons** on the client side of the application. On the server side of the application, I used **Javascript, node.js, express and mongodb**.

### First Start

First of all, you need to run the `npm start` command in the server and client in order to start the application completely.
